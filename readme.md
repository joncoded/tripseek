# tripseek

a travel-oriented chatbot that focuses on user inputs:

- travel habits
- trip origin
- trip destination
- trip length 
- trip budget
- trip party (# of adults and # of children)
- repeat visitor or first timer?

a chat will then occur with:

- AI-powered recommendations
- user clarifications

after a few questions, the AI will process the adjusted recommendations and provide a printable "summary"!
